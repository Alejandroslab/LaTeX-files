Install LaTeX in windows:

first install tex live (it will take a long time to install..).
this is necessary as it is included 'latexmk' package that is essential for the packages in Atom to work.

TeXLive will also install a lot of LaTeX packages. Doing that you will not have to manually search and download the latex package you need
You can see all the latex packages after installation in the 'TeX Live Manager' application. (this will not be valid if you install for example BasicTex)


You will have to download TeX Live even if you are in Linux (in Mac you will have to download MacTex)

After that in Atom download:

'Latex' package to compile latex fiels inside Atom (https://atom.io/packages/latex) (package from tomasjo)
'PDF View' package to preview the pdf files (you will be able to preview splitting the tabs)
'Language-LaTeX' package (to highlighting in Atom. just to check syntax)

after install everythiing, go to setting of package 'latex'

flag the 'Build on save' option ----------------------> it will allow to build automatically after saving
unflag the 'Open Result after Successful Build'-------> it will prevent from opening the file after building
unflag 'Open Result in Background'--------------------> It will prevent to open the result in background
in 'Output Directory' type build----------------------> It will create the directory 'build' inside your working folder in which will put the latex working files

now open the settings of 'language-latex' and
flag 'Soft Wrap'




now you are ready!
remember that you have first to create a file with extension '.tex' otherwise it will not be built correctly!
(it will appear the error 'the file does not appear to be as valid source file')

after creating your file and saving, latex will automatically build the file.
You will se a pdf in the project folder you can open it, splitting the screen:
to do that
click right on the pdf and select 'Split Right'

Now you have your LaTeX editor right inside you Atom!
