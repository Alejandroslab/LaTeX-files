You have 3 options with the default latex package : plain, headings or myheadings

-with plain you will get only the number of page at the foot center of the page
-with headings you will have the title of the sections in which you are reading and the number of the page at the top right corner
-with myheadings you will able to define the content of the heading and have the number of page at the top right corner

With myheadings:
\pagestyle{myheadings}
\markright{Authors name}

You can also try this that is the official alternative package to the default one
(but the problem is that you will get an horrible line in the heading):

\usepackage{fancyhdr}

\pagestyle{fancyplain}
\fancyhf{}
\rhead{ \fancyplain{}{Authors name} }
\cfoot{ \fancyplain{}{\thepage} }
