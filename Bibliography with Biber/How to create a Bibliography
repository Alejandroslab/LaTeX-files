In order to create a bibliography 

1.First create your folder that will contain your LaTeX files.
Just call it 'Mars 2' to do an example. (It will called as the main file just to make things clearer)

2.Then create a new file on TeXShop an call it 'Mars 2'
(The reason to use the name 'Mars 2' is due to the fact that LaTeX does not make difference if the name of the file contains spaces.)
Insert this:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[backend=biber]{biblatex}
\addbibresource{Mars 2.bib} %<---- This will be necessary to connect this file 
to the .bib file.

\begin{document}

Hello\cite{example}.  % \cite is a common command to make a citation. 'example' is a keyname that will invoke the reference from our .bib file.

\printbibliography

\end{document}

3. Save it and run it at least once! (In TeXShop 'Typeset' command (cmd+T)) 
This will create all the necessary files that later 'biber' command in Terminal will request (like .bcg, .bcf, etc..) 
If they will not be found then you will get an error.

3. Open again the folder with terminal (right click etc..)
and create a new file .bib that will be called as the LaTeX file so in this case: 'Mars 2.bib'. This will be the bibliography file.

REMEMBER: the folder in which you will put the .bib file must be the same of the LaTeX files.

4. Open it and insert this code that is the basic code to build your references:

@ARTICLE{example,
  author  = {Other, Anthony Norman},
  title   = {Some things I did},
  year    = {2014},
  journal = {J.~Irrep. Res.},
  volume  = {1},
  number  = {1},
  pages   = {1-10}
}

We can see that there is one reference that will be invoked with the keyname 'example' (that is reported in the latex file).

5. Now reopen terminal as we have to do the magic trick in order to connect the .bib file to the LaTeX one.
just type:

biber Mars\ 2

REMEMBER when you have spaces in the file name to use the symbol '\' to deal with that. 
Then remember to not add the extension .bib in the command!
You will see now that the process will recall the .blg and .bcf files.
You should get no errors and get in the last line of the process this text: 'INFO - Ouput to file Mars 2.bbl'.
If you get errors the bibliography will not appear.

6. Run again LaTeX in you main latex file  (you should do this just once even if sometimes this could be done twice probably) and finally will see the references correctly build up.

You are done!
